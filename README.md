NDSSCPimega Plugin
=============

Plugin for [areaDetector](https://areadetector.github.io/master/index.html) to apply
SSCPimega geometric restoration to PiMega acquired images.

Currently it depends on two binary files generated by SSCPimega python package.
It will look for them in the filepath indicated by the value of $(NDSSCPimega)FilePath.
It will reload the restoration matrix everything you caput 1 into $(NDSSCPimega)LoadMatrix.

If you try to restore something without loading the matrix, nothing will happen.
